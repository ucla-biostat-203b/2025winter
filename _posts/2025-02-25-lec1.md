## Feedback on HW3 (thanks to Tomoki!)

- Common mistakes

    - Q3. Over 10 students did not explain and speculate the unusual pattern sufficiently, particularly regarding why there are peaks at 0 AM and 7 AM.
    
    - Q4. About 8 students did not mention that there is a peak at age 91 and guess why. A histogram with binwidth > 1 cannot capture the peak. They should read MIMIC-IV documentation Dr. Zhou picked up in Q3.2.
    
    - Q6. Eight students did not average vital event values correctly. They should average (potentially) multiple values in the first storetime. The first storetime can differ by itemid.
    
    - Q7. Seven students did not define age_intime and used anchor_age instead.
    
- Bonus points (put feedback comment as it is)

    - Q3. Nice catch for negative values in length of hospital stay! Dr. Zhou guesses these might be organ donors. `+5.0`.

    - Q4. You noted a peak at age 91 (older than 89) and also cited the MIMIC-IV documentation. `+2.0`.

    - Q8. You provided some insights. `+5.0`.
    
- Less common mistake

    - Q1.1. The SICU in ADT is not a bolded line.

    - Q3.2. Adding `ymd_hms()`  to `admittime` changes some 00:00:00 to NA. Simply `minute(admittime)` and `hours(admittime)` should be used.
