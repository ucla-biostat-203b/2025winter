## Announcements

* [HW3](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw3/hw3.html) due Friday Feb 21 @ 11:59pm.

## Q&A

* Q: There is a discrepancy: HW2 Q3 asks for `mean non-invasive blood pressure (220181)`, while HW3 Q1.2 displays `Non Invasive Blood Pressure diastolic (220180)`. Thank Celeste Romano for pointing this out.

    A: It is okay to plot either `220181` or `220180` for HW3 Q1.2. For HW3 Q6, please use `220180`.
    
* Q: In HW3 Q6, find the first vital measurements for each ICU stay according to `storetime`. However, the same vital measured at multiple times can be deposited to the patient's chart at the same `storetime`. How should we handle this?

    A: Use the average vital measurement corresponding to the first `storetime` of each ICU stay.
