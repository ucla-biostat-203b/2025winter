## Tips to be successful in graduate studies

* Show up. Turn on Zoom camera.

* Time management.

* Networking.

## Mark your calendar

* Friday, June 6, 2025 (whole day): MDSH SUMMIT.

* Saturday, June 7, 2025 (morning): GLA Career Day.

## Checklist on your resume

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.  

- [ ] Linux scripting  
- [ ] Git/GitHub (give your GitHub handle)  
- [ ] Container technology: Docker (if you use it)  
- [ ] Data wrangling (Tidyverse)   
- [ ] Data visualization (ggplot2)  
- [ ] Frontend development (Shiny, web app)  
- [ ] Databases: OLAP (DuckDB), Google BigQuery (spend more time self-studying SQL)  
- [ ] Cloud computing (GCP, AWS, Azure, OCI) (if you use it)    
- [ ] High-performance computing (HPC) on cluster (if you use Hoffman2)   
- [ ] Machine learning: logistic+enet, random forest, boosting (xgboost, lightGBM), SVM, neural network  
- [ ] Deep learning with Keras+TensorFlow (PyTorch is more popular in research) (if you use it in HW5)  

* Make your GitHub repo `biostat-203b-2025-winter` public (after start of spring quarter) and show off your work to back your resume. Feel free to modify the reports after this course. You can make your GitHub repository into a webpage by using GitHub Pages.  

* **Use** these tools in your daily work: use Git/GitHub for all your homework and research projects, write weekly research report using Quarto/RMarkdown/Jupyter Notebook, give presentation using ggplot2 and Shiny, write blog/tutorial, ...

## Course evaluation

## Today

* Neural network (cont'd).

## Announcements

* [HW5](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw5/hw5.html) due **Thursday** Mar 20 @ 11:59pm.

* Mar 13 Thursday office hours and lecture will be on [Zoom](https://ucla.zoom.us/j/92818013711) 2pm-4:50pm.

* HW5 taking too long! Do less exhaustive grid search, or try smarter search strategies. Separate each task into a separate document.

    * Tidymodels: `tune_grid()`, `tune_bayes()` (Bayesian optimization through GP), `tune_sim_anneal()` (simulated annealing), `tune_race_anova()` (racing with ANOVA), `tune_race_win_loss()` (racing with win/loss statistics).

    * Python Scikit-Learn: `GridSearchCV()`, `RandomizedSearchCV()`, ... See [reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#hyper-parameter-optimizers).
