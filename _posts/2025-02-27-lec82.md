## Feedback on HW3 (thanks to Parsa!)

* Common mistakes

    * Q1: Graphs that did not display all of the required contents. A good chunk of students forgot to make the line segment thickness based on ICU/CCU
    
    * Q6: Forgetting to add the filter for `storetime <= outtime`
    
    * Q8: Having graphs that were not very readable (e.g cluttered tick axis labels, dot plots of many points without `geom_jitter`)
